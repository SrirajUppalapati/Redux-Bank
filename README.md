# Redux Bank
Redux Bank is a single-page application designed to simulate basic banking operations using React.js and Redux for state management. It provides users with the ability to perform several key banking functions seamlessly.

Account Management:
Open Account: Users can open a new bank account, which includes initializing a new account with an initial balance.
Close Account: Users can close their bank account, which removes their account from the system.
Transactions:

Deposit Money: Users can deposit money into their account, increasing their balance.
Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money from their account, reducing their balance.
Pay Loan: Users can make payments towards existing loans they have taken from the bank.
Add Loan: Users can request and receive loans from the bank, which increases their account balance and creates a debt that needs to be repaid.
State Management with Redux:

Redux manages the application's state, ensuring a single source of truth for data across components.
Actions and reducers are implemented to handle state updates for transactions, account management, and loan operations.


Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
State Management: Redux for managing application state.
